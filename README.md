# pig-game

Pig game - from a JS course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I created the logic of the game.

P.S. The rules are the following:

On a player's turn, a player can roll or hold:

  roll: The player can roll a die.
  
    When a player rolls a 1 (called a "pig"), the turn ends and the player score does not change.
    When a player rolls a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the turn continues and the player adds the roll to the turn total.
      
  hold: The player says "hold" and gives the die to the next player.
  
    When a player "holds", the turn ends and the player adds the turn total to the score.
    
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
